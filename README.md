# succbot
NOTE: This bot uses [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite) 1.0.0a. If you want to host a bot using async, i highly recommend [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot)
The second version of rbot. rbot will be discontinued.
## Requirements (not needed because this git is empty)
* [discord.py 1.0.0a](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/tree/rewrite)
* Python 3.6+ (not Python 3.5, the bot will break because the code contains 'f' strings.)
## How to install
THIS GIT IS EMPTY, DON'T EVEN ATTEMPT TO DOWNLOAD THIS CODE.
## Important note
> Do not copy and paste code, writing your own code is much better, unless you give credit to me. See the LICENSE file.
> This git will be empty, because if you were trying to find the source code for the SuccBot, then this is not the right place for you.
